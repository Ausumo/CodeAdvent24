CodeAdvent 2024 🎄💻
This repository contains my contributions to CodeAdvent 2024, a yearly coding challenge series where participants solve daily
programming tasks throughout December.

Progress ✨
I completed the first few challenges at the start of the event. These tasks gave me the opportunity to practice problem-solving, explore
different approaches, and sharpen my coding skills.

Motivation & Status 🛑
Due to time constraints and a lack of motivation, I decided to stop participating after the initial tasks. While the repository does
not include solutions for the entire event, it still documents my early progress and the way I approached the problems.

Purpose 📂
I am sharing this repository to:

Showcase my initial solutions and thought process.

Provide a reference for anyone interested in how I tackled the early challenges.

Keep a record of my participation in CodeAdvent 2024.
